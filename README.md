## 📝 Logging

All application code MUST log through the **canonical logger** at
`@/utils/logger`:

```ts
import { logger } from "@/utils/logger";

logger.debug("…");
logger.info("…");
logger.warn("…");
logger.error("…", errorObject);
```

### Why a single import path?

- One canonical implementation owns redaction, correlation IDs, JSON output,
  environment-aware levels, and singleton config (`configureLogger`).
- The legacy `@/utils/structuredLogger` module is kept as a thin
  backwards-compat wrapper (re-exports + a domain-specific `StructuredLogger`
  class with batching/remote delivery). It is marked **`@deprecated`** and an
  ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule blocks new imports outside the wrapper
  itself. New code MUST NOT import from it.
- Direct `console.*` calls are blocked by ESLint for everything except
  `src/utils/earlyErrorSuppression.ts`, which intentionally operates on the
  raw global `console` because it runs **before** `logger` is initialised to
  silence noisy browser-extension errors.

### Backwards compatibility

`@/utils/structuredLogger` re-exports `logger`, `createLogger`, `LogLevel`,
etc. from the canonical module so existing call sites continue to work
without changes. The wrapper itself (`StructuredLogger`, `logNetworkRequest`,
`logWeb3Activity`, `logTransaction`) is preserved for callers that rely on
its batching/remote-send semantics.

## 📊 Build stats plugin

`next.config.ts` includes a small `BuildStatsPlugin` that writes a JSON
snapshot of webpack output to `.next/build-stats.json` for local inspection.

To keep production builds lean and quiet, the plugin is gated by **two**
conditions:

| Condition              | Value                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `process.env.ANALYZE`  | MUST be set to `'true'`                       |
| `process.env.NODE_ENV` | MUST NOT be `production`                      |
| Server-side build?     | Plugin is client-only — skipped on `isServer` |

In other words:

```bash
# Quiet (default for `next build` in production)
npm run build

# Opt-in to the JSON build-stats snapshot — local dev only
ANALYZE=true npm run dev    # or: ANALYZE=true next build
```

Production CI MUST NOT pass `ANALYZE=true`; if it does the plugin is still
disabled by the `NODE_ENV === 'production'` guard.

## 🛠️ Local Development Guardrails (Git Hooks)

To maximize code reliability and streamline PR review cycles, this project uses **Husky** to enforce local quality validation checks prior to remote integration.

### Active Git Hook Safeguards

- **Pre-Commit Hook:** Triggered automatically upon running `git commit`. Performs light syntax linting on modified files.
- **Pre-Push Hook:** Triggered automatically when executing `git push`. This gate forces an application-wide compile verification check (`tsc --noEmit`) and runs all matching unit tests. If compilation faults are surfaced or unit assertions fail, the push is safely aborted locally, keeping broken code off the remote origin branch.

### Bypassing in Emergencies

If you must explicitly push an intermediate draft up to a private backup branch without running validations, you can bypass Husky checks by appending the `--no-verify` flag:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-branch --no-verify
```
