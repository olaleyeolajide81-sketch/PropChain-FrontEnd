## 📝 Coding Standards

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **gitleaks**: Pre-commit hook to prevent committing secrets

**Auto-format before committing**:

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix   # auto-fix ESLint issues
```

**Secret Detection**:
We use `gitleaks` to prevent committing secrets to the repository. The pre-commit hook will automatically scan staged files for sensitive information like API keys and private keys. If a secret is detected, the commit will be blocked.

If you need to commit a file that contains a value that is being flagged as a secret, but you are sure it is a false positive, you can add it to the `.secrets.baseline` file.

**Prettier config** (`.prettierrc` or `prettier.config.js`):

- Single quotes for strings
- 2-space indentation
- Trailing commas in multi-line structures
- 100-character line length limit

**TypeScript rules**:

- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Always type function return values explicitly for exported functions
- Avoid `any` — use `unknown` and narrow with type guards instead
- Use `const` assertions (`as const`) for literal tuples and objects

**React-specific rules**:

- One component per file
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components
- Use `React.FC<Props>` or explicit return type annotations
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks rather than inline in components

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`PropertyCard.tsx`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for utilities (`property-utils.ts`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`propertyData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`PropertyType`)

### Component Guidelines

```tsx
// Good component example
interface PropertyCardProps {
  property: Property;
  onPurchase?: (property: Property) => void;
}

export const PropertyCard: React.FC<PropertyCardProps> = ({
  property,
  onPurchase,
}) => {
  return <div className="property-card">{/* Component content */}</div>;
};

export default PropertyCard;
```

### Git Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Build process or dependency changes

Examples:

```

fix: resolve wallet connection issue
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for property service
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test user workflows
- **Visual Tests**: Test UI consistency

### Writing Tests

```tsx
// Example unit test
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { PropertyCard } from "./PropertyCard";

describe("PropertyCard", () => {
  const mockProperty = {
    id: "1",
    name: "Test Property",
    price: "100000",
    // ... other properties
  };

  it("renders property information correctly", () => {
    render(<PropertyCard property={mockProperty} />);

    expect(screen.getByText("Test Property")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText("$100,000")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Running Tests Locally

Before opening a PR, run the full test suite locally to catch issues early:

```bash
# 1. Unit and integration tests (Jest)
npm test

# 2. Type checking (no emitted output)
npm run type-check

# 3. Linting
npm run lint

# 4. End-to-end tests (Playwright) — requires a running dev server
npm run dev &          # start dev server in background
npm run test:e2e       # run Playwright tests
kill %1                # stop dev server

# 5. Build check — ensures the production bundle compiles cleanly
npm run build
```

**Coverage requirements**: PRs must not decrease overall coverage below the current threshold. Check the current threshold in `jest.config.js` under `coverageThreshold`.

**Running a single test file**:

```bash
npx jest src/hooks/useTransaction.test.ts
```

**Debugging a failing test**:

```bash
npx jest --verbose --no-coverage src/path/to/test.ts
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Component Library

We use a consistent design system based on:

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Headless UI** for accessible components
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Custom design tokens** for consistency

### Design Guidelines

- Follow the established color palette
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test on multiple screen sizes
- Use semantic HTML elements

## 🌐 Web3 Development

### Adding a New Wallet Connector

PropChain uses lazy-loaded wallet connector modules to keep the initial bundle small (~178 KB savings). To add support for a new wallet (e.g. Trust Wallet, Rainbow, Phantom), follow this step-by-step guide.

#### Step 1: Create the connector module

Create `src/lib/walletConnectors/<walletname>.ts`. Every connector must export two functions:

```typescript
// src/lib/walletConnectors/<walletname>.ts

export interface WalletNameConnectorResult {
  address: string; // 0x-prefixed hex address
  chainId: number; // decimal chain ID
}

/** Connect to the wallet. Must throw descriptive user-facing errors. */
export const connectWalletNameWallet =
  async (): Promise<WalletNameConnectorResult> => {
    // 1. DETECTION — check if the wallet is available
    // 2. CONNECTION — request accounts via the provider
    // 3. VALIDATION — verify the returned address and chainId
    // 4. RETURN the result
  };

/** Synchronous check: is the wallet installed and ready? */
export const isWalletNameAvailable = (): boolean => {
  // Return true only if the provider object is present and the wallet flag is set
};
```

#### Step 2: Detection

Before attempting connection, verify the wallet provider is present:

- **Injected wallets** (MetaMask, Coinbase, Rainbow): check `window.ethereum` and the wallet-specific flag (`isMetaMask`, `isCoinbaseWallet`, `isRainbow`).
- **Mobile / deep-link wallets** (Trust Wallet, Phantom): check `window.ethereum` or the wallet's own injected namespace.
- **QR-code wallets** (WalletConnect): check that the required environment variable (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`) is configured.

Throw a descriptive error if the wallet is not found:

```typescript
if (!window.ethereum?.isWalletName) {
  throw new Error(
    "WalletName is not installed. Please install the WalletName extension or app to continue.",
  );
}
```

#### Step 3: Validation

Always validate the response from the wallet before returning:

```typescript
const accounts = await provider.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });

// Validate the response shape
if (!Array.isArray(accounts) || accounts.length === 0) {
  throw new Error("No accounts returned from WalletName");
}

const address = accounts[0];
if (typeof address !== "string" || !address.startsWith("0x")) {
  throw new Error("Invalid account address received from WalletName");
}

const chainIdHex = await provider.request({ method: "eth_chainId" });
if (typeof chainIdHex !== "string") {
  throw new Error("Invalid chain ID received from WalletName");
}
```

#### Step 4: Error messages

All errors thrown by the connector MUST be user-friendly. Handle these standard cases:

| Error code       | Meaning                   | User-facing message                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4001`           | User rejected the request | `"You rejected the connection request. Please try again."`           |
| `-32002`         | Request already pending   | `"Connection request is already pending. Please check your wallet."` |
| Provider missing | Wallet not installed      | `"<WalletName> is not installed. Please install the extension."`     |
| Network error    | RPC timeout or offline    | `"Network error. Please check your connection and try again."`       |

Use `getErrorCode(error)` from `@/utils/typeGuards` to safely extract numeric error codes.

#### Step 5: Register the connector

1. **Add to `useWalletConnector.ts`**: Import the new connector and add a case for it in the `connectWallet` function.
2. **Add to `WalletModal.tsx`**: Add a button/option for the new wallet in the wallet selection UI.
3. **Add tests**: Create a test file under `src/lib/walletConnectors/__tests__/` that mocks the provider and covers connection, rejection, and missing-provider scenarios.
4. **Update this guide**: Add the new connector to the table in `src/lib/walletConnectors/README.md`.

#### Template connector

A minimal starting point is available at `src/lib/walletConnectors/README.md#adding-new-wallets`.

### Wallet Integration

When working with Web3 features:

- Test with multiple wallet providers
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Provide clear user feedback
- Support multiple networks
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Smart Contract Interaction

- Use type-safe contract interfaces
- Handle transaction states properly
- Provide gas estimates
- Implement transaction monitoring
- Handle network switching

## 📦 Package Management

### Adding Dependencies

Before adding new dependencies:

1. Check if existing dependencies can solve the problem
2. Prefer smaller, focused packages
3. Check for security vulnerabilities
4. Update documentation if needed

```bash
# Install production dependency

## 🚀 Release Process

PropChain Frontend uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases based on Conventional Commits.

### How Releases Work

1. Commits to `main` following the Conventional Commits spec are automatically parsed
2. Release Please opens a release PR that bumps the version and updates `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Merging the release PR triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Creates a Git tag (e.g. `v1.2.0`)
   - Publishes a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes
   - Deploys to the production environment

### Version Bumping Rules

| Commit type                           | Version bump    |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `fix:`                                | Patch (`1.0.x`) |
| `feat:`                               | Minor (`1.x.0`) |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | Major (`x.0.0`) |

### Hotfix Process

For urgent production fixes:

```bash
# 1. Branch from the latest release tag
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1 v1.2.0

# 2. Apply the fix and commit with conventional format
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical wallet connection crash"

# 3. Open a PR targeting main (and cherry-pick to release branch if needed)
```
